## Installation of a screen reader

NVDA is a widely used screen reader that allows blind and visually impaired people to dictate the screen while reading.
Download this reader and install it (remember to use your headset üòÑ)

## Simple exercise

The articles available on the [Developer Mozilla: Accessibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Learn/Accessibility) are excellent to start with.

- Read this page to get more material for the rest of the exercise:
    * [HTML: a good foundation for accessibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Learn/Accessibility/HTML)
    * [CSS and JavaScript accessibility best practices](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Learn/Accessibility/CSS_and_JavaScript)
- You can find a simple exercise at the following address: [accessibility in CSS and JavaScript

Apply these principles to the study project.

## In short
- Images must always have the `alt` attribute or be hidden when read by a screen reader with the `aria-hidden=true` attribute
- Contrast between background and text colour should always be sufficient.
- An outline is necessary for guided reading, it should not be hidden.
- Links should be understandable and noticeable. Consider adding a title attribute or labelling their usefulness with the `aria-labelledby` attribute
- It should be possible to navigate between the different fields of a form with information about the expected content and format.
